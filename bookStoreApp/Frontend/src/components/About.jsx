      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Welcome to <strong>Page Turner</strong>, your number one source for all kinds of books. We're dedicated to giving you the very best of literature, with a focus on quality, customer service, and uniqueness.

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Our mission is to bring the love of reading to everyone by providing a wide variety of books,  for all age groups and interests. Our bookstore has come a long way from its beginnings as an online platform. When we first started, our passion for making literature accessible to all drove us to quit our day job and focus on providing a better online bookstore experience, and that gave us the impetus to turn hard work and inspiration into a booming online store.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        We now serve customers all over the world and are thrilled to be a part of the eco-friendly, fair trade wing of the book industry. We hope you enjoy our products as much as we enjoy offering them to you.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        <strong>Happy Reading!</strong>
